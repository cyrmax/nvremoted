NVRemoted is an implementation of the [NVDA Remote][] server in Go.

`server.timeBetweenPings` controls server ping delivery only (seconds; 0 disables
pings). NVDA Remote clients do not acknowledge these pings, so valid idle
connections are allowed. `server.pingsUntilTimeout` and `--pings-until-timeout`
are deprecated and ignored, including existing nonzero values. They no longer
impose an inactivity timeout.

TCP keepalive is enabled for both TCP and TLS connections independently of
these settings, with a 15-second idle period. Probe intervals, retry counts,
and the time to detect a lost peer depend on the listener and operating system;
this is not a 15-second disconnect timeout. Transport errors and disconnects
stop the client and remove its channel membership. Keepalive cannot detect a
stalled client application while its operating system still responds to TCP.

Each client has a bounded FIFO queue of 64 pending server events, in addition
to the event being handled. A full queue disconnects that client rather than
dropping or coalescing messages on a continuing connection. Each response gets
a 10-second socket write deadline; a timeout or write error stops the connection
and prevents further protocol writes. These limits are independent of ping and
TCP keepalive settings. The write deadline does not bound reads during an
unfinished TLS handshake; there is currently no TLS handshake timeout.

Go API users can set `server.Server.EventQueueSize` and
`server.Server.WriteTimeout` before serving clients; nonpositive values use
64 and 10 seconds, respectively. The CLI uses these defaults; there are no
CLI flags or TOML keys for these limits.

To use:

* `go install github.com/n0ot/nvremoted/cmd/nvremoted`
* Create a directory, $HOME/.config/nvremoted, and copy examples/nvremoted.toml there.
* Open $HOME/.config/nvremoted/nvremoted.toml, and follow the instructions in the file.
* As NVDA Remote only uses TLS, you need to point NVRemoted at a certificate and private key.
    Self signed certificates can be generated with openssl,
    and signed certificates can be gotten from [Let's Encrypt][].
* Run `nvremoted start`

#### Building
Install [Mage][], then use

    mage build

to build, or

    mage install

to install.

`GOOS` and `GOARCH` work as you'd expect.
